    <h2 class="mb-4">Simulating 4D - What a Four-Dimensional World Actually Looks Like</h2>

    <p> 
        When you hear about 4D, what's the first thing that springs to mind? Is it a type of movie that utilizes physical factors such as motion, vibration or wind increase immersion in the cinema? Is it a proprietary piece of software used to create three-dimensional media? Or is it the idea that 3-dimensional space and 1-dimensional time are a single thing, creating a 4-dimensional fabric of reality?
    </p>
    <p>
        The truth is that all of these ideas about four dimensions aren't inheritenly wrong. This is because the definition of the word "dimension" is essentially as vague as it can get. It gets used as a fancy term all over the place for the most random of things, which I personally find to be quite frustrating, as it creates a lot of confusion about what 4-dimensional space actually is. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        I want to make it clear that this is not going to be about any of that nonsense. The entirety of this article is based solely on four-dimensional <strong>space</strong>, which, while it may be purely theoretical, I believe knowing about what it is, what it means and how one could think about it, can go a long way in altering one's perception of the world we live and the countless of hypothetical others in a truly beautiful way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this article, I want to start with 2D to 3D analogies, explain some fundamental 4D ideas and concepts, and slowly work towards explaining how a 4-dimensional creature would perceive and interact with its world, with interactive demos along the way. Aside from knowing some basic concepts such as coordinate systems, there is no prior knowledge required to understanding the ideas I will talk about here.
    </p>

    <h3>Dimensionality</h3>

    <p>
        We live in a primarily <strong>three-dimensional world</strong>. While space might indeed exist in some high-dimensional manifold, for our purposes we will just consider the simple case of reality, where there are just three perpendicular axes to move in. You can move <span class="x" ngbTooltip="x-axis">right and left</span>, <span class="y" ngbTooltip="y-axis">up and down</span> and <span class="z" ngbTooltip="z-axis">forwards and backwards</span>. In other words, any point in space can be specified using three components: <span class="x" ngbTooltip="&quot;right&quot;/&quot;left&quot;">x</span>, <span class="y" ngbTooltip="&quot;up&quot;/&quot;down&quot;">y</span> and <span class="z" ngbTooltip="&quot;forwards&quot;/&quot;backwards&quot;">z</span>. While you might recall some systems such as Blender preferring to think of <span class="y">y</span> as being "forwards and backwards" and <span class="z">z</span> as being "up and down", however, we will go with the alternative view used by systems such as Unity, which is to think of

    <h3>Life in 2D</h3>

    <p>
        In order to understand 4D, a good way to understand is to consider life in two dimensions and compare it to the 3D world we're used to. The vast majority of concepts in 2D or 3D generalize well to 4D and higher, with only a handful of exceptions (eg. rotations are a little more complex, but more about that later). 
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2D, there are only two perpendicular axes to move in, <span class="x" ngbTooltip="&quot;right&quot;/&quot;left&quot;">x</span> and <span class="y" ngbTooltip="&quot;up&quot;/&quot;down&quot;">y</span>, or in other words <span class="x" ngbTooltip="x-axis">right and left</span> and <span class="y" ngbTooltip="y-axis">up and down</span>. 
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: coordinate system x/y with point and slider]
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary idea we'll be exploring here is what if there were four axes in space instead of the three we're used to. This is simply done by introducing another axis, the <span class="w">w</span> axis, which means any point in space can be specified using three components: <span class="x" ngbTooltip="&quot;right&quot;/&quot;left&quot;">x</span>, <span class="y" ngbTooltip="&quot;up&quot;/&quot;down&quot;">y</span>, <span class="z" ngbTooltip="&quot;forwards&quot;/&quot;backwards&quot;">z</span> and <span class="w" ngbTooltip="&quot;ana&quot;/&quot;kata&quot;">w</span>. This new axis is perpendicular and independent to the other three. This means, in 4D space, there are a total of eight ways to move around: <span class="x" ngbTooltip="x-axis">right and left</span>, <span class="y" ngbTooltip="y-axis">up and down</span>, <span class="z" ngbTooltip="z-axis">forwards and backwards</span> and <span class="w" ngbTooltip="w-axis">ana and kata</span>. "<span class="w">Ana</span>" and "<span class="w">kata</span>" are terms coined by a 19th century mathematician named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Howard_Hinton" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Howard_Hinton">Charles Howard Hinton</a> to describe the "forwards" and the "backwards" of the new dimension, so moving towards "<span class="w">ana</span>" means <em>increasing</em> your <span class="w">w</span> coordinate by some amount, while moving towards "<span class="w">kata</span>" means <em>decreasing</em> your <span class="w">w</span> coordinate by some amount, just like how moving "<span class=y>up</span>" <em>increases</em> and moving "<span class="y">down</span>" <em>decreases</em> your <span class="y">y</span> coordinate.
    </p>

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>
        Having four perpendicular axes to move in is cool and all, but what does it mean, really? If 4D is not a thing in our physical world, what would it look like? This is the problem that <strong>projection</strong> aims to solve - to display a 4D scene, we have to find a way to project it onto a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3D visualization from above is not actually in fact 3D - it is merely a 2D projection of a 3D virtual world. Humans are not actually able to see in 3D. If you think that we do, then you are just confusing it with depth perception - being able to judge how far things are away is not the same as being able to truly see in 3D. The light-sensitive cells in our eyes are arranged in a 2D pattern, and two slightly offset 2D images create an illusion of 3D depth in our minds. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To better understand what I mean, let's consider how a 2D creature living in a 2D world might perceive the world.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: 2d point with 1d projection]
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, this 2D creature is only able to see 1D - just like we 3D creatures are only able to see 2D. From this it's pretty straightforward to conclude that <strong>a 4D creature must therefore be able to see in 3D</strong>. But what does it really mean to be able to see in 3D?
    </p>
    
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>
        An image, whether it's a photograph of a scene, a painting or a screenshot of a video game, is a 2D grid of pixels, each being a squares, and each having a different color. 
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: slider fills pixels of 2d grid]
    </p>
    <p>
        A 3D image, however, would contain another dimension of pixels. This would make each pixel a 3D cube instead of a 2D square:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: slider fills cubes of 3d grid]
    </p>
    <p>
        This is, essentially, what a 4D creature could see. A 4D creature would be able to see an image like this in its entirety - imagine the information of all these pixels and their positions being interpreted in its mind simultaneously. In other words, true 3D vision means being able to see a 3D image with all of its cubic pixels at once, whether they are on the outside or on the inside. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As another example for this, consider a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Since it's only able to see in 1D, no matter how it's positioned, it's not able to see what's inside the box:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: 2d creature with render with box with object. box has thickness and pattern within]
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we, as 3D creatures with our 2D vision, can indeed see what's inside the box! We can not only see the object, but also the pattern within the material the box itself is made of. It'd be no different if we moved up a dimension - a 4D creature looking down at our 3D world would be able to see it in its entirety. It would not be possible to hide anything from a 4D creature - if you had a vault they would not only be able to see the object that is inside the vault, but they would also be able to see the very material that make up the walls of that vault.
    </p>

    <h3>Hypercubes</h3>
    <p>
        Enough talking about <em>how</em> a 4D creature could see, let's talk about <em>what</em> a 4D creature might see. Arguably the simplest 4D object is the <strong>Tesseract</strong>, the 4D analogue of a 3D cube, 2D square or 1D line. An n-dimensional cube is also called a <strong>hypercube</strong>, which includes all the mentioned objects, so not only tesseracts, but also squares and cubes fall under this definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with a <strong>1D</strong> coordinate system, consisting of only the <span class="x">x</span>-axis, with two points being connected with a line:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: 1d line, two points, connected with line]
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, let's add another dimension to turn it into a <strong>2D</strong> coordinate system consisting of the <span class="x">x</span> and <span class="y">y</span> axes. We will duplicate this line, move it into the new dimension and connect all the points:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: 2d system, with line from before, slider to duplicate and move upwards]
    </p>
    <p>
        This gave us a 2D square! Let's continue. We'll now turn it into a <strong>3D</strong> coordinate system consisting of <span class="x">x</span>, <span class="y">y</span> and <span class="z">z</span> axes, and we will duplicate our square, move it into the new dimension and connect all the points:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: 3d system, with square from before, slider to duplicate and move backwards]
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, we just made a 3D cube! So far, so good - but what now? Sure, we can try to do the same thing to get to our final piece of the puzzle, the <strong>4D tesseract</strong>, by duplicating this cube, moving it into the new dimension and connecting all the vertices - but where <em>is</em> that new dimension, really? It might feel like we're already out of space for the new dimension, I mean, where could we put a fourth, perpendicular axis?
    </p>

    <h3>Tesseract</h3>
    <p>
        This questions brings us back to <strong>projection</strong> - recall that the 3D cube we saw earlier was not actually 3D, but rather a 2D projection of a 3D virtual cube. Since we humans are well-adapted to understanding 3D, we can just look at this projection of the cube and understand that it's a cube and create a model of this cube inside of our heads. However, without proper practice at least, it's not the same for 4D. <strong>To understand 4D, we have to think about how we are able to understand 3D in the first place.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the following projection of a 3D cube viewed from the front: 
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: projection of a cube, looks like square in a square]
    </p>
    <p>
        While this is essentially just a 2D image, we humans understand that it's a projection of 3D cube wireframe. However, to a 2D creature that would have no idea about 3D all they would see is a <strong>square in a square, with all corners connected</strong>. As 3D beings, however, we understand that this is not what we are actually looking at - the front square is simply connected to the back square, and both squares are actually the same size - the "smaller" looking one is just <strong>further away from the viewer</strong> than the "larger" looking one.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can do the same for 4D. To create and display a simple <strong>3D projection</strong> of a 4D tesseract, we can create a cube, duplicate it, make it "smaller" (further away from the viewer in 4D) and connect the vertices:
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        [vis: cube, slider to copy and make smaller and connect vertices]
    </p>
    <p>
        We have just made the classic tesseract model! Remember that, while it may look like a cube is inside of another cube, the "smaller" cube is really just further away from the view than the "larger" cube, and that they are both the same size in 4D space.
