<h2 class="mb-2">About Me</h2>

        I love to code, mostly in the Unity3D framework, in Python and in Angular. My two biggest projects right now are SMSH and ezgpt, which you can learn more about at <a routerLink="/projects" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.com/projects">projects</a>. I have a lot of plans for projects, but since school is taking away a lot of my free time, it's hard to focus on them. The project I'm currently working on the most is Tiersorter, check it out <a routerLink="/projects/tiersorter" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://tiersorter.ascyt.com/">here</a>!

        I mostly code in C# and in Python. I also know a good amount of C, C++ and web-development (Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). If you ever need a website, Discord bot, console application, or anything similar, hit me up!

        I'm male. Since I don't really care you can use any pronoun you want, but I might have problems trying to figure out if you're referring to me if you don't use 'he' or 'they'.

        Despite German being my native language, I also have great English skills, mostly having acquired them from the internet. Other than that I'm also able to speak a little bit of Spanish, which I've learned using Duolingo <i> (which I quit because they stupidly removed the option to use the keyboard, seriously bring that back I beg you)</i>, and a sad amount of French, given that I've had it in school for two years.

        I like to practice typing for fun, mostly using <a href="https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=ascyt" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=ascyt">typeracer</a> and <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/user/2057874/" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://10fastfingers.com/user/2057874/">10FastFingers</a>. I've been using the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/1200px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="Image showing the Dvorak layout">Dvorak keyboard layout</a> since April 2021, and am currently sitting at around 100 words per minute.

        I don't have a very wide taste in music, I mostly just listen to EDM (more precisely, Progressive House). Since most of the artists I frequently listen to are pretty unknown, you're probably not going to have heard of any of the songs I mostly listen to, but you can find some of my top songs of the past 30 days <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JWSOPMo4rrJlcpWHh5KHI" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JWSOPMo4rrJlcpWHh5KHI">here</a>.

        I intentionally kept the design of this website pretty simple, I'm not a big fan of having a lot of fancy animations, colors or effects on websites, I honestly find this pretty distracting. There may or may not be some easter eggs hidden here though, who knows? ;) <span class="hidden-text">There might be something small in my 404 site...</span>

        If for whatever reason you'd like to donate to me, you can do so on <a routerLink="/donate" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://ko-fi.com/ascyt">ko-fi</a>. Also, I'm open to commissions, so if you want me to code something for you, hit me up!
